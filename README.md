![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toidiu/consistent-rs.svg?branch=master)

This implementation was written as an exercise to better understand the original paper on Consistent Hashing. The summary of the paper can be found here: http://toidiu.com/reads

The [go implementation](https://github.com/stathat/consistent) was useful reference while implementing the Rust version.
